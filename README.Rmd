`shinyevents` provides a flexible and easy to use framework to record activity occurring withing a Shiny app. The logged information can be accumulated and later be used to help improve the app's performance and user's experience.


## Installation

The development version of `shinyevents` is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("edgararuiz/shinyevents")
```

## Usage

`shinyevents` attempts to provide a simple way to track different Shiny events by using two functions.  The first function is one of four which initialize the tracking:

- `shiny_events_to_log()` - Saves the event data into a `.log` file
- `shiny_events_to_csv()` - Saves the event data into a `.csv` file
- `shiny_events_to_dbi()` - Saves the event data into a database, via the `DBI` package
- `shiny_events_to_logger()` - Sends the event as an entry to the `logger` package

Once the target for the event tracking is chosen, `shinyevents` is initialized by assigning the function's result to a variable:

```{r}
library(shinyevents)

tracker <- shiny_events_to_log()
```

Once initialized, the second function to use, is one created inside the assigned variable.  The function is called: `event()`.  Since selected variable's name was `tracker`, to access it we use `tracker$event()`.  To it we can pass two values, as arguments, those values are free-form text, so the developer of the app can decide what to record:

```{r}
tracker$event("example", "readme")
```

By default, the log file name is `shiny-events.log`. At this point, it can be accessed in one of many ways. In this case we'll just use `readLines()`. 

```{r}
readLines("shiny-events.log")
```

A Globally Unique Identifier, or GUID, is created by `shiny_events_to_log()`.  Every event entry for that session will contain the same GUID.  This allows us to know what activity was part of which app's user session.

```{r}
tracker$event("start_app")
tracker$event("slider", "3")
tracker$event("stop_app")
```

```{r}
readLines("shiny-events.log")
```

## In a Shiny app

Here is the code for a sample app that tracks several different events:

- App's session begins
- Slider is changed, and its current value
- Beginning of the plot's output processing
- Completion of the plot's output processing
- App's session closes

Feel free to copy and run this code in your R session. There are several comments inside the code to further clarify the purpose of the tracking related activity.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinyevents)
ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(sliderInput("bins", "Bins:", 1, 50, 30)),
        mainPanel(plotOutput("distPlot"))
    ))
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    tracker <- shiny_events_to_log() # <- Initializes as log file
    tracker$event("app_initiated") # <- Tracks start of app session
    observeEvent( # <- Track input using shiny::observeEvent()
      input$bins, 
      tracker$event("bin_slider", input$bins), # <- Pass the input's value to the event
      ignoreInit = TRUE) # <- ignoreInit avoids logging the input's initial value
    session$onSessionEnded( # <- Track when the app closes using session$onSessionEnded
      function() tracker$event("close_app")) # <- Combine with a simple event entry
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        tracker$event("plot_started", input$bins) # <- Tracks code start
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
        tracker$event("plot_rendered", input$bins) # <- Tracks code completion
    })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

After playing a bit with the slider, the app can be closed.  This activity was recorded in a new file, called `shiny-events.log`.  If you tried the app code above, use the `readLines()` code below to see the resulting entries. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
readLines("shiny-events.log")
```
```

```

## Further info

Some additional information is exposed by the variable assigned to the Shiny event function. These are made available to allow developers to use them in other functions, or to create a custom target for the event tracking.  Two of these are: 

- The app's name
- The session's GUID

```{r}
tracker$app
tracker$guid
```

The `entry()` function returns a `list` object.  The list contains the session information, and the date/time of the entry.  This is the base function that the `shiny_events_to_log()`, `shiny_events_to_csv()` and  `shiny_events_to_dbi()` use. 

```{r}
tracker$entry()
```

### Custom event

It is possible to customize the output or add a new target file (beyond CSV, log or Database).  To do that, override the `event()` function after assigning it to a variable.  For example, if a pipe delimited file is required for tracking the Shiny events, we could use the following:

```{r}
tracker <- shiny_events()
tracker$event <- function(activity = "", value = "") { 
  entry <- tracker$entry(activity = activity, value = value)
  cat(
    paste(entry$guid, entry$datetime, entry$app, entry$activity, entry$value, "\n", sep = "|"),
    file = "shinyevents-pipe.txt",
    append = TRUE
  )
}
tracker$event("example", "readme")
readLines("shinyevents-pipe.txt")
```

## CSV example

Initialize a new CSV log with `shiny_events_to_csv()`.  

```{r}
tracker <- shiny_events_to_csv()
tracker$event("start_app")
tracker$event("slider", "3")
tracker$event("stop_app")
```

To avoid file locks, `shiny_events_to_csv()` uses the `cat()` function inside its code.  It also means that the table will not have headers, so they have to be defined at read time:

```{r}
read.csv(
  "shiny-events.csv",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  header = FALSE,
  col.names = c("guid", "app", "activity", "value", "datetime")
)
```

## Database example

`shiny_events_to_dbi` uses the `DBI` package to record events.  Here are a few highlights of how it works:

- Uses the `dbWriteTable()` function, this allows it to work on most databases `DBI` is able to interact with
- The `append = TRUE` argument is used.  This allows the table to be created if it doesn't exists yet, and only to add new records to the table, instead of overriding its content.
- It creates, or expects, a table with the following names: `guid`, `app`, `datetime`, `activity`, `value`.


```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "example.db")
```


```{r}
tracker <- shiny_events_to_dbi(table = "shinyevents", connection = con)
tracker$event("start_app")
tracker$event("slider", "3")
tracker$event("stop_app")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM shinyevents")
```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```

## Example using `logger`

To combine with the `logger` package, simply use `shiny_events_to_logger()`.  The `log_appender()` function should be initialized before running the first `event()` function.

```{r}
library(logger)

t <- tempfile()

log_appender(appender_file(t))

tracker <- shiny_events_to_logger()
tracker$event("start_app")
tracker$event("slider", "3")
tracker$event("data_frame", "0", "warn")
tracker$event("stop_app")

readLines(t)
```


## Sample apps

The package includes several app examples.  The example pictured below, uses `shiny_events_to_dbi()` to record the events in a database, in this case SQLite.  It records when there are changes in each of the inputs, as well as when the plot;s code starts and ends. There are entries for when the app starts and is closed.

<br/>

Run the following code in your R session to access the app:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny::runApp(
  system.file(
    "samples", "shinydashboard-db", 
    package = "shinyevents"
    ), 
  display.mode = "normal"
  )
```

### Additional samples

- *Simple example* - An example using the "Old Faithful Geyser" app, shows the easiest way to include `shinyevents` in an app.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    shiny::runApp(
      system.file(
        "samples", "simple", 
        package = "shinyevents"
        ), 
      display.mode = "normal"
      )
    ```

- *shinydashboard* - An example that looks the same as the `shinydashboard` example above, but it uses a CSV file to record the events instead of a database.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    shiny::runApp(
      system.file(
        "samples", "shinydashboard", 
        package = "shinyevents"
        ), 
      display.mode = "normal"
      )
    ```
